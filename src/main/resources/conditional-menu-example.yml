# Conditional Menu Example
# This example demonstrates the powerful conditions system for controlling item visibility
#
# CONDITION SYNTAX:
#   Conditions control when items are visible or accessible in the menu.
#   They support PlaceholderAPI placeholders and various operators.
#
# PERMISSION OPERATORS:
#   - HASPERM: Checks if player has a permission
#     Example: "HASPERM deluxehub.vip"
#
#   - NOTHASPERM: Checks if player does NOT have a permission
#     Example: "NOTHASPERM deluxehub.banned"
#
# STRING OPERATORS:
#   - EQUALS: Checks if two values are equal (case-sensitive)
#     Example: "%player_name% EQUALS Notch"
#
#   - EQUALSIGNORECASE: Checks if two values are equal (case-insensitive)
#     Example: "%player_world% EQUALSIGNORECASE LOBBY"
#
#   - NOTEQUALS: Checks if two values are NOT equal (case-insensitive)
#     Example: "%player_gamemode% NOTEQUALS SPECTATOR"
#
#   - CONTAINS: Checks if first value contains second value
#     Example: "%player_world% CONTAINS spawn"
#
#   - STARTSWITH: Checks if value starts with text
#     Example: "%player_name% STARTSWITH Admin"
#
#   - ENDSWITH: Checks if value ends with text
#     Example: "%player_world% ENDSWITH _nether"
#
#   - MATCHES: Checks if value matches regex pattern
#     Example: "%player_name% MATCHES ^[A-Z].*"
#
# NUMERIC OPERATORS:
#   - ATLEAST: Number is greater than or equal (>=)
#     Example: "%player_level% ATLEAST 10"
#
#   - ATMOST: Number is less than or equal (<=)
#     Example: "%player_health% ATMOST 5"
#
#   - GREATERTHAN: Number is strictly greater than (>)
#     Example: "%vault_eco_balance% GREATERTHAN 1000"
#
#   - LESSTHAN: Number is strictly less than (<)
#     Example: "%player_food_level% LESSTHAN 10"
#
# LOGICAL OPERATORS:
#   - AND: Both conditions must be true
#     Example: "HASPERM deluxehub.vip AND %player_level% ATLEAST 5"
#
#   - OR: At least one condition must be true
#     Example: "HASPERM deluxehub.vip OR HASPERM deluxehub.admin"
#
#   - NOT: Inverts the condition
#     Example: "NOT HASPERM deluxehub.banned"
#
# GROUPING:
#   - Use brackets () for single-depth grouping
#     Example: "(%player_name% EQUALS Notch) OR (HASPERM deluxehub.admin)"
#     Example: "(HASPERM deluxehub.vip AND %player_level% ATLEAST 10) OR HASPERM deluxehub.admin"
#
# MULTIPLE CONDITIONS:
#   You can use a list for multiple conditions (all must be true - AND logic)
#   conditions:
#     - "HASPERM deluxehub.access"
#     - "%player_level% ATLEAST 5"
#
# NOTE: Conditions are parsed left to right. Spacing is important!
